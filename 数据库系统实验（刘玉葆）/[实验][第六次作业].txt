1.

2.

3.
CREATE VIEW T1
AS SELECT salary
FROM TEACHERS

GRANT SELECT

TO USER1
WITH GRANT OPTION

4.
CREATE VIEW T2

5.
GRANT SELECT

TO USER2
WITH GRANT OPTION

6.
GRANT SELECT 
ON TEACHERS
TO USER3
WITH GRANT OPTION

GRANT SELECT 
ON TEACHERS
TO USER2

成功，因为SQL允许循环授权。

7.
REVOKE SELECT
ON STUDENTS
FROM USER1 

成功，因为在第一题已经对public角用户授权了，而在此题未对public角色收回权限，所以USER2还是可以对STUDENTS进行查询。

8. 
REVOKE SELECT
ON COURSES
FROM USER1

REVOKE SELECT
ON COURSES
FROM USER2
